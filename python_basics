1. Create a zoo.py file first. Define the hours() function, which prints the string &#39;Open 9-5 daily&#39;.
Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.

Ans:- You can save a file in compiler or your python ground by naming that "zoo.py"
not below code as definition in it :-
def hours():
  print("jai shree ram")
  
  then after this , open another python compiler and import zoo in compiler and call hours unction in it to find the out put as below.
  
  import zoo
  zoo.hours()
  
  after running above code output will be "jai shree ram" as we mentioned in another file "zoo.py"
  
  2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.
  
  Ams:-
  this is basically same question as above , here we are assigning another variable to this zoo name that will make the code writing easier
  example are as below:_
  
  import zoo as ram
  ram.hours()
  and output wiill be same as we got saved in out file "zoo.py"
  
  3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the hours() function from zoo.
  Ans:-
  Yes we can call that directly too , that is not too hard , find example as below.
  
  from zoo import hours
  
  hours()
  
  and output will be the same as we got saved in file "zoo.py"
  
  
  4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.
  Ans:-
  This is like assigning the many variable to a single function , we can assign hours() as info and we can call it as below:-
  
  from zoo import hours as info
  info()
  
  and output will be as we got saved in our file "zoo.py"
  
  5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs &#39;a&#39;: 1, &#39;b&#39;: 2, and &#39;c&#39;: 3, and print it out.
