1. Create a zoo.py file first. Define the hours() function, which prints the string 'Open 9-5 daily'. Then, use the interactive interpreter to import the zoo module and call its hours() function.
Ans:-
Here is how we can make a module with function  hours as below:-
def hours():
       print("Open 9-5 daily")
now we have save this file as zoo.py  and then we can import the "zoo" module in another file by writing below code
import zoo
zoo.hours()
and ourput will be Open 9-5 daily.
2. In the interactive interpreter, import the zoo module as menagerie and call its hours() function.
Ans:-
Here is how we can call zoo module by giving a variable ;
import zoo as menagerie 
menagerie .hours()
and here output will be "Open 9-5 daily"
3. Using the interpreter, explicitly import and call the hours() function from zoo.
Ans:-
Here is how we can call explicitly hours with below code ;
from zoo import hours
hours()
here output will be "Open 9-5 daily"
4. Import the hours() function as info and call it.
Ans:-
here is below how we can call  hours ffunction as below as info and then we can use it:-
from  zoo import hours as info
info()
here also output will be "Open 9-5 daily"
5. Create a plain dictionary with the key-value pairs 'a': 1, 'b': 2, and 'c': 3, and print it out.
Ans:-
here as below we can create a plain directory and we can print the same as well:-
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
print(my_dict)
Here as above code output will be "{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}"

6.Make an OrderedDict called fancy from the same pairs listed in 5 and print it. Did it print in the same order as plain?
Ans:-
To create orderdict we have to import the orderdict from collection and the we can write fency dict as below :-
rom collections import OrderedDict

fancy = OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
print(fancy)
and here in above code output will be as below :-
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
7. Make a default dictionary called dict_of_lists and pass it the argument list. Make the list dict_of_lists['a'] and append the value 'something for a' to it in one assignment. Print dict_of_lists['a'].
Ans:-
Here is how we can create a default dict as below by importing defaultdict from collection and the we can append dict content as follows:-
from collection import defaultdict
dict_of_list=defaultdict(List)
dict_of_list["a"],append("something for a")
and then if we call a as follow , then output will be accordingly.
print(dict_of_list["a"])
here output will be ["something for a"]
